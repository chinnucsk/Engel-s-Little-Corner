		<h1>Engel's little corner</h1>
		<div class="p">
			Welcome to my little corner of the web! My name is Engel Sanchez.  I live in the green and beautiful neighborhood of 
			<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica_Plain,_Boston">Jamaica Plain</a>
			in Boston, Massachusetts, with my wife and two young daughters.  I am a software engineer by birth.  I <b>love</b>
			coding. 
			The great thing about software is that it is an universally useful tool.  By itself it is nothing 
			more than criptic symbols controlling very unforgiving machines.  But when put to good use
			it can help solve problems in any field, help people be more productive or simply entertain them.  
			Those of us who love making software get a chance to learn a bit of everything.  And that is great, because 
			the one thing I love more than coding is learning.  Quite a few other interests compete for my time:

			Unfortunately there is only so much time during the day.  I haven't read a book in French or Portuguese in ages, my beautiful guitar has not been touched in months, adrenaline pumping chess matches happen perhaps once a weeka and Salsa Fridays only every few weeks.
			One has to prioritize and have clear goals to experience the satisfaction of achieving them.  This year the goals are to become an expert modeler and animator in <a href="http://blender.org">Blender</a>, profficient at programming sounds with <a href="http://puredata.info/">Pure data</a>, release a <a href="http://unity3d.com">Unity</a> game with assets and sound effects created by me, get my visual data processing framework out there as an open source project and digest a few other Math books.  And that is the list <b>after</b> prioritizing</b>.  I am going to need lots of energy and tons of luck :).

<h2>Summary</h2>
<div>An experienced engineer with strong programming
skills and a hungry brain. I am a true generalist: I love working
on web and desktop user interfaces, visualization applications, the
back end of high traffic web applications, complex algorithms
running on massive amounts of data and the services and
communication systems that connect it all together. I have used a
variety of frameworks and built my own from scratch when needed. I
have built entire systems on my own and as a technical lead. I care
about what I do and want to do it right, and would like to work
with similar minded people. But life is not just work! I'm looking
for teammates who enjoy a beer and a little fun after a hard day at
work.</div>
<h3>Core skills</h3>
<div> Hard-core
C/C++, Java, SQL, DB tuning (MySQL, Postgresql, SQL Server),
Javascript, jQuery, CSS and HTML. &nbsp;Pretty good with C#, Perl,
bash, Ruby (and its rails) and Python. I have written my own
mini-languages (lex, yacc, Javacc). I&rsquo;m an
<b>insanely</b>
fast learner.</div>

<h3>Other skills</h3>
<div>
Game
programming (Unity, UDK). Graphics creation and editing (Photoshop,
Gimp, Inkscape). 3D modeling and animation in Blender. Audio
processing and sound synthesis in Pure Data. Realtime 3D graphics
and GPU programming (OpenGL, DirectX). Game AI.
</div>

<h2>Professional Experience</h2>

<h3>August 2010 &ndash; Present :
Software Mercenary at Pellion Technologies</h3>

<div>This a continuation of my CMC gig below.
 &nbsp;With funding from <a href="http://arpa-e.energy.gov" target="_blank">ARPA-E</a>
 and private investors, the group
became Pellion Technologies. &nbsp;In addition to my previous list
of responsibilities, I am building their laboratory software system
by extending an electronic notebook system (Labtrack) to collect
and analyze the data from the synthesis and electrochemical
experiments. &nbsp;Using jQuery, C# and Java services, ASP.NET.
&nbsp;All of their data from the lab as well as related data from
our materials simulation cluster is available through a portal
website built from scratch. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve learned the ins and
outs of life in the lab to continue building and refining all the
data organization and analysis tools needed to develop a
groundbreaking new energy technology, and even worn a science hat
running complex materials simulations used to guide the lab work.
I&rsquo;m also the Google Apps administrator and first line of IT
defense, dealing with very arcane electrochemical testing
systems.</div>

<h3>November 2009 &ndash; August 2010 :
Senior Software Engineer at Computational Modeling Consultants
(CMC)</h3>

<div>Worked with a small group of world class MIT
materials science PhDs. Streamlined and automated data processing
to turn their high performance Linux cluster into a lean and mean
materials simulation machine. &nbsp;Implemented and optimized the
various algorithms that compute material properties in the cluster
to run incrementally and efficiently. &nbsp;Reworked and optimized
their Postgresql database making it 1 to 2 orders of magnitude
faster. &nbsp;Built an automated email report system.
&nbsp;Enhanced and optimized their data analysis and visualization
Java Swing based application, including adding the ability to
easily design new materials and send them to the cluster. System
administration and security for their Wiki and Linux systems
(Ubuntu and Centos). &nbsp;Spent long hours studying Chemistry,
Math and Physics just to survive in a world of PhDs. &nbsp;And I
did it all in my pajamas, working from home.</div>

<h3>2009 July &ndash; October : Senior
Implementation Consultant at ChoiceStream (contract)</h3>

<div>Helping out my old employer with some
challenging data processing projects for big customers (Echostar
and EBay), tuning a 40h data crunching process to run in under 5h.
This was a temporary, part-time position working
remotely.</div>

<h3>2009 March - July : Living the life</h3>

<div>I quit my job and spent months messing with
game development, graphics programming, game AI, 3D modeling and
audio programming. &nbsp;I worked on my own open source game
project <a href="http://hunter.sf.net" target="_blank">Hunter</a>
and contributed to the indie game <a href="http://www.citeremis.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=126&Itemid=427&lang=en"  target="_blank">

Principal Software Engineer at ChoiceStream, Cambridge
MA</h3>

<div>As one of the first developers to join the
company, I worked on many projects and demos involving complex and
ever-changing customized recommendation algorithms for big name
customers on extremely tight schedules. Our architecture included a
core C++ multi-threaded recommendation engine back end, Java web
application layer and lots of offline user data processing to feed
the online system. I worked and left my mark in every area of the
system. Close collaboration with scientists, content experts and
implementation services people was always required to deliver our
solutions. I started and lead the data processing infrastructure
team from around Nov 2007 to Feb 2008, then took over the large
scale offline data processing project around Feb 2008, where I was
mainly responsible for improving processing time from about 80
hours to under 3.</div>

		<div class="p">
			<a href="http://blender.org">Blender</a> is quite possibly the most amazing open source software package out there.  You can
			create 3D models, texture paint them, animate them, render stills and short films, add post-processing effects, edit video and audio and even create entire games with it.
		</div>
		<div class="p">
			Here's a little tutorial in which I quickly demonstrate how to create a simple 3D model, texture paint it and animate it in about 12 minutes.

	<div class="section" id="music">
		<div>
		Learning to make music has been an obsession of mine for many, many years.  I have absolutely no natural talent 
		in this area. But I love it way too much to ever quit.  For as long as I have fingers, my digital piano, guitar, ukulele
		and melodica will get more punishment than they deserve.  I am mostly self taught, which means I have 
		many more bad habits than good. Luckily my friend Evan, who has been my daughter's Kindermusik teacher for
		years, gave me proper guitar playing lessons for a good year or two and was able to rectify a lot of
		my self inflicted problems.
		</div>
		<div>
		The biggest Aha! moment I experience in my long music learning journey came from reading the 
		book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Play-Piano-Despite-Years-Lessons/dp/0385142633">
		How to Play the Piano Despite Years of Lessons</a>.
		It's quite an old book, but it helped me greatly. It really shows you the essence of music
		theory and encourages you to mess around with music without giving too 
		much thought to the "right" way of doing things.  Get a solid understanding of the basics first, then
		the rest is just to practice, practice, practice. But practicing without understanding is wasted time.

	<div class="section" id="salsa">
		<div class="p">A sampler of different Salsa dancers and styles.  Some dancers
		like acrobatics and fancy knots, some are smoother, some are just a lot of fun to watch.  It is very easy to 
		get addicted this style of dancing.  It's sizzling hot, and it can be highly technical.  Dancing with a partner
		and keeping your leads fun and interesting is a complex problem that can be very appealing to geeks like me.  And yes,
		I am planning to write some software to tacklet this problem :).
