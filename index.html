		<h2>Engel's little corner</h2>
		<div>
		Welcome to my little corner of the web! My name is Engel Sanchez.  I live in the green and beautiful neighborhood of 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica_Plain,_Boston">Jamaica Plain</a>
		in Boston, Massachusetts, with my wife and two young daughters.  During the day I am a computer
		geek of the worst kind.  And it doesn't get any better at night. I write software for a living and 
		I write software in the little spare time I have.  Except on Friday nights, when I become a Salsa Dancing Freak.
		</div>
		<div>
		I love coding.  All kinds of coding.  I love programming graphics, building user interfaces,
		tuning databases, crunching massive amounts of data in Java, going hard-core with C++ or 
		toying around with the modern crop of dynamic languages.  As an engineer, what matters
		to me is finding solutions to real problems. If I knew carpentry I would probably solve them with wood, but
		software is what I know.  Happiness is writing a piece of software that makes
		someone's life easier, someone's worker lighter or provides a good amount of entertainment, an essential
		element to a happy life.
		It's also doing it while feeding the brain a ton of new knowledge and doing it with people
		who are team players and share your drive and passion.

<h2>Summary</h2>
<div>An experienced engineer with strong programming
skills and a hungry brain. I am a true generalist: I love working
on web and desktop user interfaces, visualization applications, the
back end of high traffic web applications, complex algorithms
running on massive amounts of data and the services and
communication systems that connect it all together. I have used a
variety of frameworks and built my own from scratch when needed. I
have built entire systems on my own and as a technical lead. I care
about what I do and want to do it right, and would like to work
with similar minded people. But life is not just work! I'm looking
for teammates who enjoy a beer and a little fun after a hard day at
work.</div>
<h3>Core skills</h3>
<div> Hard-core
C/C++, Java, SQL, DB tuning (MySQL, Postgresql, SQL Server),
Javascript, jQuery, CSS and HTML. &nbsp;Pretty good with C#, Perl,
bash, Ruby (and its rails) and Python. I have written my own
mini-languages (lex, yacc, Javacc). I&rsquo;m an
<b>insanely</b>
fast learner.</div>

<h3>Other skills</h3>
<div>
Game
programming (Unity, UDK). Graphics creation and editing (Photoshop,
Gimp, Inkscape). 3D modeling and animation in Blender. Audio
processing and sound synthesis in Pure Data. Realtime 3D graphics
and GPU programming (OpenGL, DirectX). Game AI.
</div>

<h2>Professional Experience</h2>

<h3>August 2010 &ndash; Present :
Software Mercenary at Pellion Technologies</h3>

<div>This a continuation of my CMC gig below.
 &nbsp;With funding from <a href="http://arpa-e.energy.gov" target="_blank">ARPA-E</a>
 and private investors, the group
became Pellion Technologies. &nbsp;In addition to my previous list
of responsibilities, I am building their laboratory software system
by extending an electronic notebook system (Labtrack) to collect
and analyze the data from the synthesis and electrochemical
experiments. &nbsp;Using jQuery, C# and Java services, ASP.NET.
&nbsp;All of their data from the lab as well as related data from
our materials simulation cluster is available through a portal
website built from scratch. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve learned the ins and
outs of life in the lab to continue building and refining all the
data organization and analysis tools needed to develop a
groundbreaking new energy technology, and even worn a science hat
running complex materials simulations used to guide the lab work.
I&rsquo;m also the Google Apps administrator and first line of IT
defense, dealing with very arcane electrochemical testing
systems.</div>

<h3>November 2009 &ndash; August 2010 :
Senior Software Engineer at Computational Modeling Consultants
(CMC)</h3>

<div>Worked with a small group of world class MIT
materials science PhDs. Streamlined and automated data processing
to turn their high performance Linux cluster into a lean and mean
materials simulation machine. &nbsp;Implemented and optimized the
various algorithms that compute material properties in the cluster
to run incrementally and efficiently. &nbsp;Reworked and optimized
their Postgresql database making it 1 to 2 orders of magnitude
faster. &nbsp;Built an automated email report system.
&nbsp;Enhanced and optimized their data analysis and visualization
Java Swing based application, including adding the ability to
easily design new materials and send them to the cluster. System
administration and security for their Wiki and Linux systems
(Ubuntu and Centos). &nbsp;Spent long hours studying Chemistry,
Math and Physics just to survive in a world of PhDs. &nbsp;And I
did it all in my pajamas, working from home.</div>

<h3>2009 July &ndash; October : Senior
Implementation Consultant at ChoiceStream (contract)</h3>

<div>Helping out my old employer with some
challenging data processing projects for big customers (Echostar
and EBay), tuning a 40h data crunching process to run in under 5h.
This was a temporary, part-time position working
remotely.</div>

<h3>2009 March - July : Living the life</h3>

<div>I quit my job and spent months messing with
game development, graphics programming, game AI, 3D modeling and
audio programming. &nbsp;I worked on my own open source game
project <a href="http://hunter.sf.net" target="_blank">Hunter</a>
and contributed to the indie game <a href="http://www.citeremis.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=126&Itemid=427&lang=en"  target="_blank">

ever-changing customized recommendation algorithms for big name
customers on extremely tight schedules. Our architecture included a
core C++ multi-threaded recommendation engine back end, Java web
application layer and lots of offline user data processing to feed
the online system. I worked and left my mark in every area of the
system. Close collaboration with scientists, content experts and
implementation services people was always required to deliver our
solutions. I started and lead the data processing infrastructure
team from around Nov 2007 to Feb 2008, then took over the large
scale offline data processing project around Feb 2008, where I was
mainly responsible for improving processing time from about 80
hours to under 3.</div>

		<div>
		Learning to make music has been an obsession of mine for many, many years.  I have absolutely no natural talent 
		in this area. But I love it way too much to ever quit.  For as long as I have fingers, my digital piano, guitar, ukulele
		and melodica will get more punishment than they deserve.  I am mostly self taught, which means I have 
		many more bad habits than good. Luckily my friend Evan, who has been my daughter's Kindermusik teacher for
		years, gave me proper guitar playing lessons for a good year or two and was able to rectify a lot of
		my self inflicted problems.
		</div>
		<div>
		The biggest Aha! moment I experience in my long music learning journey came from reading the 
		book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Play-Piano-Despite-Years-Lessons/dp/0385142633">
		How to Play the Piano Despite Years of Lessons</a>.
		It's quite an old book, but it helped me greatly. It really shows you the essence of music
		theory and encourages you to mess around with music without giving too 
		much thought to the "right" way of doing things.  Get a solid understanding of the basics first, then
		the rest is just to practice, practice, practice. But practicing without understanding is wasted time.

		and keeping your leads fun and interesting is a complex problem that can be very appealing to geeks like me.  And yes,
		I am planning to write some software to tacklet this problem :).

			Reading this book has been one of the most rewarding experiences I have had.  The treatment of the subject is solid 
			and old school.  It is eye opening to go from playing with matrices and memorizing methods to calculate simple determinants 
			to understanding the general concepts of linear spaces and operators.  Linear algebra is the foundation for so much of the math
			you use in computer simulations, graphics and much more. It is truly everywhere.

			<div class="review">
			I love this book, love it, love it. I'm devouring it right now.  Although I never took
			digital signal processing classes in college, I did somehow end up doing undergraduate
			research in the DSP lab.  I was exposed to the basic concepts back then, but I never had a
			reason to revisit them until recently.  While working on my little Unity game prototype
			I got stuck when it came time to add sound effects.  There are not that many free sound samples or
			effects out there and times are tough. So I started looking into techniques for creating sounds
			<i>Ab Initio</i>, from nothing but your computer and creativity.  That is how I came across this
			wonderful book and the Pure Data graphical audio processing environment.  Andy Farnell gives
			a great overview of sound theory, including psychoacoustics, then teaches you the ins and outs of 
			processing and creating sound with Pure Data with many great, practical examples.  He might say
			he tried to make it all look simple and avoided too many math formulas, but that doesn't mean 
			he will not throw a differential equation at you when explaining harmonic oscillators, or that 
			you can really dig into the meat of the book without a good understanding of Fourier analysis
			and frequency domain concepts, so brush up on those before attempting to read this book.

			I never thought I would be reading about Solid State Chemistry, but when you are 
			then only without a PhD at work you gotta do what you gotta do to survive. After
			studying the basics of Chemistry from Wikipedia and the 
			<a href="http://www.khanacademy.org">Khan Academy</a>, I needed a book to get me
			deeper into the subject and found this on Amazon.com after a bit of research.
			The coverage is great, and most if not all of this book applies to what my group is doing:
			Crystal structures, bonding models, characterization of materials, electric and magnetic properties
			of materials, interpretation of phase diagrams and synthesis.  It is very well written with
			very detailed and thorough explanations. Even though the graphics are simple and the style
			slightly outdated, Mr. West's careful explanation of something as complex as the 3D structure
			of Spinels is easy to follow. That is a testament to his teaching abilities. 
			This book is big, comprehensive and cheap. What else could you possibly need? :)

			I learned about C++ metaprogramming at the 2005 C++ Connections conference and immediately bought this book.
			It really opened up a world of possibilities for me.  C++ detractors are quick to dismiss metaprogramming
			(and often generic programming) as extra fluff.  In my opinion, if you avoid these more advanced C++ concepts
			you might as well just code in Java or C. You can and should not use these techniques in every line of 
			every program or library you write, but where they make sense they unleash a whole lot of power.

			I tried to teach myself piano playing and music theory for quite a while with limited success.  How I wish I had found this book many
			years before!  Learning about the circle of fifths and how to approach music in a relaxed, fun way from this book
			was one of the most enlightening moments of my
			life, and definitely a big turning point.  For the first time I thought "I get this; This is how I should listen
			to music and this is how I can to create it".  Chords stopped being just hundreds of weird, random
			conundrums.  Songs were no longer arbitrary groups of notes to memorize individually.  Patterns emerged
			from the darkness. For the first time my ears were able to identify the basic features of a musical piece and 
			I could actually remember it for much longer.  Transposing into other keys seemed natural.  And I learned
			how to simplify a song or play with variations without fear. 
			Music was within my reach!  All you have to do after reading this book is practice, practice, practice
			(no trick or book out there will ever change that basic fact about music playing).  I may have been able
			to learn how to understand music this way from the right teacher, who knows? But that is not how it happened.
			This book is what did it for me, and it will always have a special place in my heart for that.

			This is the first book I bought when I became interested in the field artificial intelligence  (AI)
			for games.  I was quite surprised at first when I realized how few of the techniques you usually think
			of when AI are commonly used in games.  Neural networks are almost universally shunned except in a handful
			experimental, mostly indie games, for example.  So after reading this book I had the impression that it 
			was too simple and it would be put away and forgotten while I studied more advanced stuff.  But as soon as 
			I was writing AI code for my first game project, this was the book I kept coming back to over and over.
			Simple techniques and a lot of tuning of heuristics is what game AI is mostly about these days, and this 
			book is absolutely a good primer and reference.  It covers, among other things, group movement, 
			finite state machines, fuzzy logic, the A* 
			searching algorithm (the bread and butter of Game AI), basic probability, rules based systems as well as
			more classical topics like neural networks and bayesian networks just in case you are brave (or foolish) 
			enough to use them in a game.

			I was only briefly exposed to Graph Theory in high school while studying for the Math Olympiads,

			Kr&ouml;nigsberg Bridge</a> and similar problems.
			One good day I decided to look into it a bit more and luckily found this book in my local library

			It's well explained, short, sweet and everything an introductory book should be.

			<div class="review">
			I bought this book on the same year that my man Rich Stevens died and recently read the whole thing again 
			(only skipping the now useless XTI chapters).
			It is absolutely still relevant and much more. Even though it deals with very low level networking stuff, 
			you will not find a technical book as readable as this one. It goes beyond simply
			teaching the networking APIs. It really helps you to get a grip
			on the details under the hood of the TCP, IP and UDP protocol layers and a bit of the history
			that created some of the quirky corners of the APIs.  Mr. Stevens was an incredibly talented man. 
			It's just terrible that he passed away so soon. Who knows what other works of art he would have created in 
			these last ten years.

			Yes, you may laugh at me. I still use Photoshop 7.0. The program was nearly perfect when I got it almost
			ten years ago and it can still do everything I need it to do.  Especially after reading this book.
			There are plenty of well explained tricks and a CD full of effects and other goodies. I can not say I am
