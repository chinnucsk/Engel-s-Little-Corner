			Reading this book has been one of the most rewarding experiences I have had.  The treatment of the subject is solid 
			and old school.  It is eye opening to go from playing with matrices and memorizing methods to calculate simple determinants 
			to understanding the general concepts of linear spaces and operators.  Linear algebra is the foundation for so much of the math
			you use in computer simulations, graphics and much more. It is truly everywhere.

			I love this book, love it, love it. I'm devouring it right now.  Although I never took
			digital signal processing classes in college, I did somehow end up doing undergraduate
			research in the DSP lab.  I was exposed to the basic concepts back then, but I never had a
			reason to revisit them until recently.  While working on my little Unity game prototype
			I got stuck when it came time to add sound effects.  There are not that many free sound samples or
			effects out there and times are tough. So I started looking into techniques for creating sounds
			<i>Ab Initio</i>, from nothing but your computer and creativity.  That is how I came across this
			wonderful book and the Pure Data graphical audio processing environment.  Andy Farnell gives
			a great overview of sound theory, including psychoacoustics, then teaches you the ins and outs of 
			processing and creating sound with Pure Data with many great, practical examples.  He might say
			he tried to make it all look simple and avoided too many math formulas, but that doesn't mean 
			he will not throw a differential equation at you when explaining harmonic oscillators, or that 
			you can really dig into the meat of the book without a good understanding of Fourier analysis
			and frequency domain concepts, so brush up on those before attempting to read this book.

			I never thought I would be reading about Solid State Chemistry, but when you are 
			then only without a PhD at work you gotta do what you gotta do to survive. After
			studying the basics of Chemistry from Wikipedia and the 
			<a href="http://www.khanacademy.org">Khan Academy</a>, I needed a book to get me
			deeper into the subject and found this on Amazon.com after a bit of research.
			The coverage is great, and most if not all of this book applies to what my group is doing:
			Crystal structures, bonding models, characterization of materials, electric and magnetic properties
			of materials, interpretation of phase diagrams and synthesis.  It is very well written with
			very detailed and thorough explanations. Even though the graphics are simple and the style
			slightly outdated, Mr. West's careful explanation of something as complex as the 3D structure
			of Spinels is easy to follow. That is a testament to his teaching abilities. 
			This book is big, comprehensive and cheap. What else could you possibly need? :)

			I learned about C++ metaprogramming at the 2005 C++ Connections conference and immediately bought this book.
			It really opened up a world of possibilities for me.  C++ detractors are quick to dismiss metaprogramming
			(and often generic programming) as extra fluff.  In my opinion, if you avoid these more advanced C++ concepts
			you might as well just code in Java or C. You can and should not use these techniques in every line of

			I tried to teach myself piano playing and music theory for quite a while with limited success.  How I wish I had found this book many
			years before!  Learning about the circle of fifths and how to approach music in a relaxed, fun way from this book
			was one of the most enlightening moments of my
			life, and definitely a big turning point.  For the first time I thought "I get this; This is how I should listen
			to music and this is how I can to create it".  Chords stopped being just hundreds of weird, random
			conundrums.  Songs were no longer arbitrary groups of notes to memorize individually.  Patterns emerged
			from the darkness. For the first time my ears were able to identify the basic features of a musical piece and 
			I could actually remember it for much longer.  Transposing into other keys seemed natural.  And I learned
			how to simplify a song or play with variations without fear. 
			Music was within my reach!  All you have to do after reading this book is practice, practice, practice
			(no trick or book out there will ever change that basic fact about music playing).  I may have been able
			to learn how to understand music this way from the right teacher, who knows? But that is not how it happened.
			This book is what did it for me, and it will always have a special place in my heart for that.

			This is the first book I bought when I became interested in the field artificial intelligence  (AI)
			for games.  I was quite surprised at first when I realized how few of the techniques you usually think
			of when AI are commonly used in games.  Neural networks are almost universally shunned except in a handful
			experimental, mostly indie games, for example.  So after reading this book I had the impression that it 
			was too simple and it would be put away and forgotten while I studied more advanced stuff.  But as soon as 
			I was writing AI code for my first game project, this was the book I kept coming back to over and over.
			Simple techniques and a lot of tuning of heuristics is what game AI is mostly about these days, and this 
			book is absolutely a good primer and reference.  It covers, among other things, group movement, 
			finite state machines, fuzzy logic, the A* 
			searching algorithm (the bread and butter of Game AI), basic probability, rules based systems as well as
			more classical topics like neural networks and bayesian networks just in case you are brave (or foolish) 
			enough to use them in a game.

			I bought this book on the same year that my man Rich Stevens died and recently read the whole thing again 
			(only skipping the now useless XTI chapters).
			It is absolutely still relevant and much more. Even though it deals with very low level networking stuff, 
			you will not find a technical book as readable as this one. It goes beyond simply
			teaching the networking APIs. It really helps you to get a grip
			on the details under the hood of the TCP, IP and UDP protocol layers and a bit of the history
			that created some of the quirky corners of the APIs.  Mr. Stevens was an incredibly talented man. 
			It's just terrible that he passed away so soon. Who knows what other works of art he would have created in 
			these last ten years.

			Yes, you may laugh at me. I still use Photoshop 7.0. The program was nearly perfect when I got it almost
			ten years ago and it can still do everything I need it to do.  Especially after reading this book.
			There are plenty of well explained tricks and a CD full of effects and other goodies. I can not say I am
			a power user, but reading this book literally doubled my Photoshop graphic manipulation abilities.
