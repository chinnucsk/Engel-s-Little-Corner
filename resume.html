<h2>Summary</h2>
<div>An experienced engineer with strong programming
skills and a hungry brain. I am a true generalist: I love working
on web and desktop user interfaces, visualization applications, the
back end of high traffic web applications, complex algorithms
running on massive amounts of data and the services and
communication systems that connect it all together. I have used a
variety of frameworks and built my own from scratch when needed. I
have built entire systems on my own and as a technical lead. I care
about what I do and want to do it right, and would like to work
with similar minded people. But life is not just work! I'm looking
for teammates who enjoy a beer and a little fun after a hard day at
work.</div>
<h3>Core skills</h3>
<div> Hard-core
C/C++, Java, SQL, DB tuning (MySQL, Postgresql, SQL Server),
Javascript, jQuery, CSS and HTML. &nbsp;Pretty good with C#, Perl,
bash, Ruby (and its rails) and Python. I have written my own
mini-languages (lex, yacc, Javacc). I&rsquo;m an
<b>insanely</b>
fast learner.</div>

<h3>Other skills</h3>
<div>
Game
programming (Unity, UDK). Graphics creation and editing (Photoshop,
Gimp, Inkscape). 3D modeling and animation in Blender. Audio
processing and sound synthesis in Pure Data. Realtime 3D graphics
and GPU programming (OpenGL, DirectX). Game AI.
</div>

<h2>Professional Experience</h2>

<h3>August 2010 &ndash; Present :
Software Mercenary at Pellion Technologies</h3>

<div>This a continuation of my CMC gig below.
 &nbsp;With funding from <a href="http://arpa-e.energy.gov" target="_blank">ARPA-E</a>
 and private investors, the group
became Pellion Technologies. &nbsp;In addition to my previous list
of responsibilities, I am building their laboratory software system
by extending an electronic notebook system (Labtrack) to collect
and analyze the data from the synthesis and electrochemical
experiments. &nbsp;Using jQuery, C# and Java services, ASP.NET.
&nbsp;All of their data from the lab as well as related data from
our materials simulation cluster is available through a portal
website built from scratch. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve learned the ins and
outs of life in the lab to continue building and refining all the
data organization and analysis tools needed to develop a
groundbreaking new energy technology, and even worn a science hat
running complex materials simulations used to guide the lab work.
I&rsquo;m also the Google Apps administrator and first line of IT
defense, dealing with very arcane electrochemical testing
systems.</div>

<h3>November 2009 &ndash; August 2010 :
Senior Software Engineer at Computational Modeling Consultants
(CMC)</h3>

<div>Worked with a small group of world class MIT
materials science PhDs. Streamlined and automated data processing
to turn their high performance Linux cluster into a lean and mean
materials simulation machine. &nbsp;Implemented and optimized the
various algorithms that compute material properties in the cluster
to run incrementally and efficiently. &nbsp;Reworked and optimized
their Postgresql database making it 1 to 2 orders of magnitude
faster. &nbsp;Built an automated email report system.
&nbsp;Enhanced and optimized their data analysis and visualization
Java Swing based application, including adding the ability to
easily design new materials and send them to the cluster. System
administration and security for their Wiki and Linux systems
(Ubuntu and Centos). &nbsp;Spent long hours studying Chemistry,
Math and Physics just to survive in a world of PhDs. &nbsp;And I
did it all in my pajamas, working from home.</div>

<h3>2009 July &ndash; October : Senior
Implementation Consultant at ChoiceStream (contract)</h3>

<div>Helping out my old employer with some
challenging data processing projects for big customers (Echostar
and EBay), tuning a 40h data crunching process to run in under 5h.
This was a temporary, part-time position working
remotely.</div>

<h3>2009 March - July : Living the life</h3>

<div>I quit my job and spent months messing with
game development, graphics programming, game AI, 3D modeling and
audio programming. &nbsp;I worked on my own open source game
project <a href="http://hunter.sf.net" target="_blank">Hunter</a>
and contributed to the indie game <a href="http://www.citeremis.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=126&Itemid=427&lang=en"  target="_blank">

<h3>Feb 2001 &ndash; March 2009 :
Principal Software Engineer at ChoiceStream, Cambridge
MA</h3>

<div>As one of the first developers to join the
company, I worked on many projects and demos involving complex and
ever-changing customized recommendation algorithms for big name
customers on extremely tight schedules. Our architecture included a
core C++ multi-threaded recommendation engine back end, Java web
application layer and lots of offline user data processing to feed
the online system. I worked and left my mark in every area of the
system. Close collaboration with scientists, content experts and
implementation services people was always required to deliver our
solutions. I started and lead the data processing infrastructure
team from around Nov 2007 to Feb 2008, then took over the large
scale offline data processing project around Feb 2008, where I was
mainly responsible for improving processing time from about 80
hours to under 3.</div>

<ul>
<li><span>Java UI apps for demos.</span></li>
<li><span>High traffic java web applications running
in some of the web's busiest portals.</span></li>
<li><span>C++ &nbsp;algorithms in the multi-threaded
recommendations engine.</span></li>
<li><span>I personally developed or lead the
development of</span>
<ul>
<li><span>A Java MVC web framework</span></li>
<li><span>The Pipeline infrastructure for the C++
high performance web service
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Java/SQL framework for large scale data
processing.</span></li>
</ul>
</li></ul>

<h3>July 1998 &ndash; Feb 2001 Software
Engineer at Raytheon, Marlborough MA</h3>

<div><span>Worked on the display component of the STARS
Air Traffic Control system fixing bugs and implementing the main
toolbar UI. Coding was done in C, X11 and Motif. For about 4 months
I was on loan implementing Java Swing screens for a Navy terminal
project.</span></div>

<h2>Other</h2>
<div>
<span>When not working or chasing after my young
daughters I can be found working on my personal software projects,
playing my nylon acoustic guitar, dabbling on the piano, playing
online chess or studying Math, Physics and Chemistry. One day I
want to help build The Matrix.</span>
